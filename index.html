<p><img style="float:right" height="400" width="384" src="paramore.jpg" alt="Original Paramore Band"></p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/paramore">Paramore</a> is an American rock band from Franklin, Tennessee formed in 2004. The band currently consists of Hayley Williams and Taylor York. Their first release was their debut album <i>All We Know Is Falling</i> in 2005. Although they had minimal commercial performance initially, the album and its lead single <q>Pressure</q> were eventually certified Gold by RIAA after the success of the band's later material. </p>
<p>The band's second album, <i> Riot!</i> was released in 2007. Three of the songs on this album made it to the mainstream limelight and was certified Platinum in the United States. They also received a Best New Artist nomination at the 2008 Grammy Awards.</p>
<p>The next year, they came out with the album <i> Brand New Eyes</i> and landed number two on <i>Billboard</i> 200 with 175,000 first week sales. This went platinum as well in Ireland and the UK and gold in US, Canada, Austrailia and New Zealand. Unfortunately, two of the band memebers, Josh and Zac Farro, the brothers, left in 2010. </p>
<p>The band released their first self-titled album in 2013. <em><b>This gave the band their first career number one on the US <i>Billboard</i> 200 </b></em>and was also the number one album in the UK, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, Brazil, Argentina and Mexico. <q>Ain't It Fun</q> won the Grammy Award for Best Rock Song for Hayley Williams and Taylor York as songwriters, making it Paramore's first Grammy win. Nearing the end of 2015, bassist Jeremy Davis left the band.</p>
